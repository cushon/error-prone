## The problem
The @IncompatibleModifiers annotation declares that the target annotation is
incompatible with a set of provided modifiers. This check ensures that all
annotations respect their @IncompatibleModifiers specifications.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("IncompatibleModifiers")` to the enclosing element.
