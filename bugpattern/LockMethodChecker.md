## The problem
Methods with the @LockMethod annotation are expected to acquire one or more
locks. The caller will hold the locks when the function finishes execution.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("LockMethodChecker")` to the enclosing element.
