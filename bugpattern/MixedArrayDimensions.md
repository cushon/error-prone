## The problem
The Java language allows the `[]` to be placed after the declaration of a
variable or method:

```java
int foos[];
int getFoos() [] {
  return xs;
}
```

The example above is equivalent to the following, strongly preferred, form:

```java
int[] foos;
int[] getFoos() {
  return xs;
}
```

The
[Java Language Specification ยง8.4](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4)
notes:

> The declaration of a method that returns an array is allowed to place some or
> all of the bracket pairs that denote the array type after the formal parameter
> list. This syntax is supported for compatibility with early versions of the
> Java programming language. It is very strongly recommended that this syntax is
> not used in new code.

Placing the square brackets immediately after the type is required by the
[Google Java Style Guide][style].

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("MixedArrayDimensions")` to the enclosing element.
