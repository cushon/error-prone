## The problem
Calling `toString` on objects that don't override `toString()` doesn't provide
useful information (just the class name and the `hashCode()`).

Consider overriding toString() function to return a meaningful String describing
the object.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("ObjectToString")` to the enclosing element.
