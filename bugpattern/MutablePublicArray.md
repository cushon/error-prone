title: MutablePublicArray
summary: Non-empty arrays are mutable, so this `public static final` array is not
  a constant and can be modified by clients of this class.  Prefer an ImmutableList,
  or provide an accessor method that returns a defensive copy.

## The problem
Nonzero-length arrays are mutable. Declaring one `public static final` indicates
that the developer expects it to be a constant, which is not the case. Making it
`public` is especially dangerous since clients of this code can modify the
contents of the array.

There are two ways to fix this problem:

1.  Refactor the array to an `ImmutableList`.
2.  Make the array `private` and add a `public` method that returns a copy of
    the `private` array.

See [Effective Java 3rd Edition ยง15][ej3e-15] for more details.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("MutablePublicArray")` to the enclosing element.
