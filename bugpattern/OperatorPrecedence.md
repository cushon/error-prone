## The problem
The [Google Java Style Guide ยง4.7][style] states:

> Optional grouping parentheses are omitted only when author and reviewer agree
> that there is no reasonable chance the code will be misinterpreted without
> them, nor would they have made the code easier to read. It is not reasonable
> to assume that every reader has the entire Java operator precedence table
> memorized.

[style]: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.7-grouping-parentheses

Use grouping parentheses to disambiguate expressions that contain both `||` and
`&&`, or both shift and arithmetic operators.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("OperatorPrecedence")` to the enclosing element.
