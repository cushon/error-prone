## The problem
Abstract classes' constructors are only ever called by subclasses, never directly by another class. Therefore they never need public constructors: protected is accessible enough.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("PublicConstructorForAbstractClass")` to the enclosing element.
