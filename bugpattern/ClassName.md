## The problem
Google Java Style Guide ยง2.1 states, "The source file name consists of the
case-sensitive name of the top-level class it contains, plus the .java
extension."

## Suppression

Since `@SuppressWarnings` cannot be applied to package declarations, this
warning can be suppressed by annotating any top-level class in the compilation
unit with `@SuppressWarnings("ClassName")`.
