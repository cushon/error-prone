## The problem
Methods that return an ignored [Observable | Single | Flowable | Maybe ] generally indicate errors.

If you donâ€™t check the return value of these methods, the observables may never execute. It also means the error case is not being handled

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("RxReturnValueIgnored")` to the enclosing element.
