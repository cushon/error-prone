## The problem
Classes should not be declared inside `package-info.java` files.

> Typically package-info.java contains only a package declaration, preceded
> immediately by the annotations on the package. While the file could
> technically contain the source code for one or more classes with package
> access, it would be very bad form.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("PackageInfo")` to the enclosing element.
