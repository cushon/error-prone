## The problem
The Thread is created with `new`, but is never started and is not otherwise
captured.

Threads must be started with `start()` to actually execute.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("DeadThread")` to the enclosing element.
