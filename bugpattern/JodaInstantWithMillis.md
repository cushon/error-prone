## The problem
Joda-Time's 'instant.withMillis(long)' method is often a source of bugs because it doesn't mutate the current instance but rather returns a new immutable Instant instance. Please use new Instant(long) instead.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("JodaInstantWithMillis")` to the enclosing element.
