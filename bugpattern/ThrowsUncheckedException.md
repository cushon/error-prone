## The problem
[Effective Java 3rd Edition ยง82][ej3e-82] says:

> Use the Javadoc `@throws` tag to document each unchecked exception that a
> method can throw, but do not use the throws keyword to include unchecked
> exceptions in the method declaration.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("ThrowsUncheckedException")` to the enclosing element.
