  instead of the general collection interface type (such as List)

## The problem
A field initialized to hold an [immutable collection][javadoc] should be
declared using the `Immutable*` type itself (such as `ImmutableList`), not the
general collection interface type (such as `List`), or `Iterable`. This
communicates several very useful semantic guarantees to consumers, as explained
in the [documentation][javadoc].

Although these classes are *technically* not interfaces (in order to prevent
unauthorized implementations), they *are* actually interfaces in the sense used
by [Effective Java 3rd Edition ยง64][ej3e-64] ("Refer to objects by their
interfaces").

So, prefer this:

```java
static final ImmutableList<String> COUNTRIES =
    ImmutableList.of("Denmark", "Norway", "Sweden");
```

over this:

```java
static final List<String> COUNTRIES =
    ImmutableList.of("Denmark", "Norway", "Sweden");
```

or this:

```java
static final Iterable<String> COUNTRIES =
    ImmutableList.of("Denmark", "Norway", "Sweden");
```

TIP: Using the immutable type for the field declaration allows Error Prone to
prevent accidental attempts to modify the collection at compile-time (see
[`ImmutableModification`]).

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("MutableConstantField")` to the enclosing element.
