## The problem
Calling a method that modifies a collection on an immutable implementation (e.g.
`ImmutableList.add`) is guaranteed to always throw an
`UnsupportedOperationException` and leave the collection unmodified.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("ImmutableModification")` to the enclosing element.
