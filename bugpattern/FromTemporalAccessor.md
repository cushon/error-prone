## The problem
Not all java.time types can be created via from(TemporalAccessor). For example, you can create a Month from a LocalDate (Month.from(localDate)) because a LocalDate consists of a year, month, and day. However, you cannot create a LocalDate from a Month (since it doesn't have the year or day information). Instead of throwing a DateTimeException at runtime, this checker validates the type transformations at compile time using static type information.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("FromTemporalAccessor")` to the enclosing element.
