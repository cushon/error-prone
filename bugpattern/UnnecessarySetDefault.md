## The problem
NullPointerTester comes with built-in support for some well known types like
`Optional` and `ImmutableList` via guava's
[`ArbitraryInstances`](http://static.javadoc.io/com.google.guava/guava-testlib/23.0/com/google/common/testing/ArbitraryInstances.html)
class. Explicitly calling `setDefault` for these types is unnecessary.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("UnnecessarySetDefault")` to the enclosing element.
