## The problem
JodaTime's type.plus(long) and type.minus(long) methods are often a source of bugs because the units of the parameters are ambiguous. Please use type.plus(Duration.millis(long)) or type.minus(Duration.millis(long)) instead.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("JodaPlusMinusLong")` to the enclosing element.
