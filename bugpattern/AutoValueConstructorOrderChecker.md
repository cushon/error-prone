## The problem
AutoValue constructors are synthesized with their parameters in the same order
as the abstract accessor methods. Calls to the constructor need to match this
ordering.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("AutoValueConstructorOrderChecker")` to the enclosing element.
