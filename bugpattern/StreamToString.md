## The problem
The `toString` method on a `Stream` will print its identity, such as
`java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$Head@6d06d69c`. This is rarely what was
intended.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("StreamToString")` to the enclosing element.
