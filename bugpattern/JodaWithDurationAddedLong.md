## The problem
JodaTime's type.withDurationAdded(long, int) is often a source of bugs because the units of the parameters are ambiguous. Please use type.withDurationAdded(Duration.millis(long), int) instead.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("JodaWithDurationAddedLong")` to the enclosing element.
