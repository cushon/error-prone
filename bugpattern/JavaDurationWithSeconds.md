## The problem
Duration's withSeconds(long) method is often a source of bugs because it returns a copy of the current Duration instance, but _only_ the seconds field is mutated (the nanos field is copied directly). Use Duration.ofSeconds(seconds, duration.getNano()) instead.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("JavaDurationWithSeconds")` to the enclosing element.
