## The problem
Duration's withNanos(int) method is often a source of bugs because it returns a copy of the current Duration instance, but _only_ the nano field is mutated (the seconds field is copied directly). Use Duration.ofSeconds(duration.getSeconds(), nanos) instead.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("JavaDurationWithNanos")` to the enclosing element.
